    <h3>BIO</h3>
    <p> I have had many seasons in my career and software development is one 
    I hope lasts a long time. I have been working in higher education for 9 years 
    and am currently an academic advisor in Chicago. Moving from higher education to
     software development is the biggest leap I have taken in my adult life and I have never been 
     more excited and anxious. I live in the Andersonville neighborhood of Chicago with my 
     wife Kris, our baby Archie and our two Boston Terrier pups George and Molly. </p>
